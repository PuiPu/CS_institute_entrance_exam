# recursive definition
> A tree is a finite set of one or more nodes such that
> (1) there is a specially designated node call <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">root</mark>
> (2) the remaining nodes are partitioned into n>=0 <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">disjoint set</mark> T_1, T_2, ... , T_n, where each of these sets is a tree, T_1, ... , T_n are called the subtrees of the root
# terminology
1. degree = # subtrees
2. degree of the tree = maximum degree of the nodes in the tree
